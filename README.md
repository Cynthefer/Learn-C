<p>C and C++ are high-performance programming languages widely used in system and application development. C, a procedural language, is efficient and close to hardware, making it ideal for operating systems, embedded systems, and networking. C++, an extension of C, introduces object-oriented programming (OOP), supporting classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. It is popular in game development, high-frequency trading, AI, and large-scale applications. Both languages offer fine-grained memory control but require careful management to avoid security risks. Their speed and versatility make them essential for operating systems, game engines, and cybersecurity tools, maintaining their relevance in modern computing. They can both be used in:
